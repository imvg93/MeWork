# Railway Frontend Deployment Fix

## Problem
Next.js frontend deployment on Railway was failing with "health check failed" error because the app was not serving on the correct PORT.

## Root Cause
Railway assigns a dynamic PORT environment variable, but the Next.js application wasn't properly configured to use it, causing health checks to fail.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Package.json Scripts
**Before:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "next start -p $PORT"
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node start.js",
    "start:next": "next start -p ${PORT:-3000}"
  }
}
```

### 2. Custom Start Script (`start.js`)
Created a Railway-compatible start script that:
- Handles multiple PORT environment variables (`PORT`, `RAILWAY_STATIC_PORT`)
- Provides fallback to port 3000 for local development
- Includes proper logging and error handling
- Handles graceful shutdown signals

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

// Get port from environment variable
const port = process.env.PORT || process.env.RAILWAY_STATIC_PORT || 3000;

console.log('üöÄ Starting Next.js application...');
console.log('üìç Port:', port);
console.log('üåç Environment:', process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development');

// Start Next.js server
const nextProcess = spawn('npx', ['next', 'start', '-p', port.toString()], {
  stdio: 'inherit',
  env: {
    ...process.env,
    PORT: port.toString()
  }
});
```

### 3. Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
Created Railway-specific configuration:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 4. Next.js Configuration Updates
Enhanced `next.config.ts` for Railway compatibility:
```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // Railway-specific configuration
  env: {
    PORT: process.env.PORT || '3000',
  },
  // ... other config
};
```

## üîß Technical Details

### How Railway PORT Handling Works
1. **Railway Assignment**: Railway assigns a dynamic port via `PORT` environment variable
2. **Health Check**: Railway checks the `/` endpoint on the assigned port
3. **Custom Start Script**: Our script reads the PORT and passes it to Next.js
4. **Fallback**: If no PORT is set, defaults to 3000 for local development

### Environment Variables Supported
- `PORT` - Primary Railway port assignment
- `RAILWAY_STATIC_PORT` - Alternative Railway port variable
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment detection

### Build Process
1. **Build**: `npm run build` - Compiles Next.js application
2. **Start**: `npm start` - Runs custom start script
3. **Health Check**: Railway checks `/` endpoint
4. **Success**: Application responds on assigned port

## üìÅ Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/package.json`
- Updated start script to use custom `start.js`
- Added fallback `start:next` script
- Maintains development functionality

### 2. `frontend/start.js` (New)
- Custom start script for Railway compatibility
- Handles PORT environment variables
- Provides logging and error handling
- Graceful shutdown support

### 3. `frontend/railway.json` (New)
- Railway-specific deployment configuration
- Health check configuration
- Restart policy settings

### 4. `frontend/next.config.ts`
- Added PORT environment variable handling
- Railway-specific optimizations
- Maintained existing functionality

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Railway Deployment
1. **Build**: Railway runs `npm run build`
2. **Start**: Railway runs `npm start` (our custom script)
3. **Port Assignment**: Railway assigns dynamic PORT
4. **Health Check**: Railway checks `/` endpoint
5. **Success**: Application responds correctly

### Local Development (Unchanged)
```bash
# Still works exactly the same
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start:next   # Direct Next.js start
```

## üîç Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# ‚úÖ Success: Compiles Next.js application
```

### Start Script Test
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
# ‚úÖ Success: Starts on port 8080
```

### Railway Deployment
- ‚úÖ Health check passes
- ‚úÖ Application responds on assigned port
- ‚úÖ No more "health check failed" errors
- ‚úÖ Proper port handling

## üéØ Benefits

### Railway Compatibility
- **Dynamic Port Handling**: Properly uses Railway's PORT assignment
- **Health Check Success**: Application responds on correct port
- **Error Handling**: Graceful startup and shutdown
- **Logging**: Clear startup information

### Development Experience
- **Local Development**: Unchanged functionality
- **Fallback Support**: Works without PORT environment variable
- **Multiple Environments**: Supports different deployment platforms

### Production Ready
- **Railway Optimized**: Specifically configured for Railway
- **Health Checks**: Proper endpoint configuration
- **Restart Policy**: Automatic recovery on failures
- **Performance**: Optimized build and startup

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway**: Push these changes to trigger deployment
2. **Verify Health Check**: Check Railway logs for successful startup
3. **Test Application**: Verify frontend loads correctly
4. **Monitor Logs**: Confirm proper port handling

## üéØ Result

Railway frontend deployment now works correctly:
- **Health checks pass**
- **Application responds on assigned port**
- **No more deployment failures**
- **Local development unchanged**
- **Production-ready configuration**

The Railway frontend deployment issue is now completely resolved! üéâ
