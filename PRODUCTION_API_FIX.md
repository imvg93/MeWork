# Production API Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Route Conflict
**Problem**: The `/api/jobs/employer` route was conflicting with `/api/jobs/:id` route, causing "employer" to be treated as an ObjectId.

**Solution**: Changed the route from `/employer` to `/employer/jobs` to avoid conflicts.

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/routes/jobs.ts`: Updated route from `router.get('/employer', ...)` to `router.get('/employer/jobs', ...)`
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Updated API call from `/jobs/employer` to `/jobs/employer/jobs`

### 2. Frontend API Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend was correctly configured to use Railway URL for production, but the route conflict was causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: The API service was already properly configured with environment-based URL switching.

## Environment Configuration

### For Vercel Deployment (Frontend)

You need to set the following environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://studentjobs-backend-production.up.railway.app/api
```

**Steps to set in Vercel**:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add new variable:
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://studentjobs-backend-production.up.railway.app/api`
   - Environment: Production (and Preview if needed)

### For Railway Deployment (Backend)

The backend should already be deployed and running. Make sure your Railway service is accessible at:
`https://studentjobs-backend-production.up.railway.app`

## How the API URL Resolution Works

The frontend automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate API URL:

1. **Development (localhost)**: Uses `http://localhost:5000/api`
2. **Production (Vercel)**: Uses Railway backend URL `https://studentjobs-backend-production.up.railway.app/api`
3. **Fallback**: If `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not set, falls back to localhost

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test KYC Endpoints
```bash
# These should now work correctly
GET /api/kyc/employer/{employerId}/status
POST /api/kyc/employer
```

### 2. Test Jobs Endpoints
```bash
# This should now work correctly (no more ObjectId error)
GET /api/jobs/employer/jobs
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backend**: The changes are already made and should work when deployed to Railway
2. **Frontend**: 
   - Set the environment variable in Vercel
   - Redeploy the frontend
   - The API calls should now work correctly

## Verification

After deployment, check:
1. âœ… KYC status API calls work
2. âœ… KYC submission API calls work  
3. âœ… Jobs API calls work (no more "employer" ObjectId error)
4. âœ… All API calls go to Railway backend in production

## Summary of Changes

1. **Backend**: Fixed route conflict by changing `/employer` to `/employer/jobs`
2. **Frontend**: Updated API service to use the new endpoint
3. **Environment**: Documented the required environment variable setup

The API calls should now work correctly in production! ðŸŽ‰
